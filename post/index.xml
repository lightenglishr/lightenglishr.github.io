<p>作者指出：计算语言学被定义为一个广泛的领域，其中计算机程序、组织的计算机技术和数据处理被用来模拟语言在特定情况和问题领域的功能，以及计算机语言模型在语言学和相关学科中的使用.计算语言学主要关注收集、积累、处理和检索信息过程的语言支持。Python 是一种简单而强大的高级面向对象编程语言，具有出色的语言数据处理能力。 Python 创始人 Guido van Rossum 的主要目标是为广泛的人群创建一种简单易懂的编程语言。如今，没有文本分析和处理的项目是不完整的。Python 拥有广泛的库和框架来完成各种任务。任务可以是微不足道的：文本音调分析、实体识别，以及更有趣的机器人、支持聊天中的对话。此外，应用的多样性也令人赏心悦目，这表明 Python 可以巧妙地解决广泛的任务。</p>

<h2 id="一研究背景">一、研究背景</h2>
<p>作者指出：通过分析政治言论获得的信息有助于追踪政治家在特定背景下使用的言论对建立权力、影响力和对人民的控制的影响，以及了解政治家的目标和意图。在与人的交流中，主要目标是传递信息并被正确理解。借助特殊的连接词，这将更容易实现，这不仅可以美化语言，还可以帮助对话者理解您的信息主题。而语言研究方法本身直到最近才被用于与政治话语的互动。</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2 id="二研究过程">二、研究过程</h2>
<p>研究方法：</p>
<p>使用Python编程语言</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2 id="三数据来源">三、数据来源</h2>
<p>威廉·杰斐逊·克林顿 (William Jefferson Clinton) 的著作《比尔·克林顿总统的演讲》(Speeches of President Bill Clinton)为载体，其中收录比尔·克林顿的 37 篇演讲。</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2 id="四研究发现">四、研究发现：</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>识别了比尔·克林顿在演讲中使用的连接词。分析美国前总统比尔克林顿的演讲，可以确定这位政治家使用了大量属于加法、效果和顺序组的词。比尔·克林顿 (Bill Clinton) 的每一次演讲都需要一些东西并激励我们。他们总是从远方开始。比尔克林顿使用策略来认同人民。这有助于向人们表明他是“他们的”并且可以信任他。比尔·克林顿试图走近人民，代表人民说话。这使得他的演讲更加情绪化，也更容易被普通美国人理解。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>使用连接词和短语可以提高演讲质量。大多数形式的书面和口头演讲和演示都是以类似的方式组织的，包括问题陈述、自己的观点和结论。连接词和短语充当所说内容各部分之间的桥梁。他们将每个部分组合在一起，以及每个部分中的句子和段落，甚至一个句子中的两个想法。连接词不仅仅是通过改善声音来美化你的语言的口头技巧。这些词具有特殊含义，可以使读者或听众以某种方式思考您的想法并做出反应。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>政治话语无疑是语言使用的主要领域，长期以来一直吸引着研究者的兴趣。这是因为政治话语是一种复杂的人类活动，值得批判性研究，特别是因为它在社会组织和管理中的核心地位。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>政治演讲不仅仅是展示领导人魅力的机会。它在大多数人无法访问数字平台的国家尤其有帮助，因为说话是直接与他们互动的最佳方式。这项研究的结果将有助于确定通过使用各种语言技术进行有效政治交流的基本原则。</p>

<h2 id="一研究背景">一、研究背景</h2>
<p>作者指出：当前关于 <strong>LPB(language positivity bias)作用机制</strong> 的驱动因素有普遍的普遍的认知偏差、情感状态、客观环境和社会规范，但是究竟是哪种机制驱动LPB，以及这种影响是否可能是由于这些或其他因素子集之间的相互作用驱动的，尚无研究讨论。造成这种不确定性的一个原因是，以前对 LPB 的调查采用了语言的共时方法，并且无法提供任何洞察力来了解 LPB 在给定语言中是否或在何种程度上具有跨时间和上下文的稳定。在该研究中，作者采用了一种将 LPB 视为动态现象的方法。具体来说，使用两个带时间戳的美国英语语料库，研究 LPB 中的经度变化作为主观、客观和社会因素的函数。这种方法可以研究 LPB 的历时变化，这是一个未探索的影响维度，而且还可以在先前提出的 LPB 解释之间进行裁决。</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2 id="二研究过程">二、研究过程</h2>
<p>提出五个假设：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LPB没有线性趋势</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LPB 随着时间的推移而增加。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LPB 随着时间的推移而减少。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LPB 的变化来预测，环境恶化将与LPB的降低相关联。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LPB的变化将通过集体影响的变化来预测，因此国家层面幸福感的下降将与LPB的下降相关。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>开展四个研究：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>线性趋势</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>战争伤亡人数</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>经济苦难</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>主观幸福</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2 id="三数据来源">三、数据来源</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>情感词典</strong>：使用了语言查询和字数统计 (LIWC) 词典 (56) 中的正面和负面情绪词类别，其中包含 907 个词和词干。正面类别有 408 个条目，负面类别有 499 个条目。</li>
<li><strong>战争伤亡人数</strong>：使用了来自美国退伍军人事务部 (57) 的情况说明书中的数据，并计算了过去两个世纪美国参与的战争中美国军人的平均伤亡人数。</li>
<li><strong>痛苦指数</strong>：使用了来自 <a href="https://www.miseryindex.us">www.miseryindex.us</a> 的数据，其中包含 1948 年至 2015 年期间美国的苦难指数指标。</li>
<li><strong>幸福指数</strong>：使用了世界幸福数据库中有关美国幸福感的调查数据。</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2 id="四研究发现">四、研究发现：</h2>
<ol>
<li>美式英语中情感词的使用随着时间的推移而减少。</li>
<li>发现了 LPB 纵向下降趋势的令人信服的证据。这种趋势在谷歌 Ngrams 语料库中非常强烈，在纽约时报语料库中略显重要。</li>
<li>发现 LPB 也随着战争的伤亡人数而减少。</li>
<li>LPB 可以通过客观环境的不太极端的测量来预测。在控制时间后，我们发现痛苦指数较高的年份在两个语料库中的 LPB 水平往往较低。</li>
<li>发现 LPB 的短期波动随全国幸福指数的变化而变化。</li>
<li>这些结果进一步证实了LPB 不能简单地解释为普遍认知机制的功能。</li>

<h3 id="51-实验数据集">5.1 实验数据集</h3>
<p>美国政治在其年轻的生命周期中经历了许多意识形态的动荡。这些动荡被称为政治时代。“政治时代是指在历史和政治科学中使用的一种美国政治模式，用于分类存在于美国的政党制度。” 数据集作者创建这个数据集的原因是为了正确讨论过去的政治事件，了解各个时期的政治平台和氛围是很重要的。例如，民主党和共和党的政治理念在不同的时期发生了巨大的变化，党派之间的理念也在不断转变、涌现和消失。截至目前为止，美国政治中已经公认了6个政治时代，分别是：</p>
<ol>
<li>第一党派制度（1792年至1824年）</li>
<li>第二党派制度（1828年至1854年）</li>
<li>第三党派制度（1854年至1895年）</li>
<li>第四党派制度（1896年至1932年）</li>
<li>第五党派制度（1932年至1964年）</li>
<li>第六党派制度（1964年至今）</li>

      <description>生活长度增加和家庭规模缩小是导致祖父母变得更加重要的两个大的人口趋势。</description>

<p>Jan 31st 2023 The Economist</p>
<p>​       生活长度增加和家庭规模缩小是导致祖父母变得更加重要的两个大的人口趋势。全球预期寿命从1960年的51岁增加到了72岁，而同期一位女性的预期生育数量则从5个减少到了2.4个。这意味着活着的祖父母与孩子的比例不断增加。</p>
<p>​       令人惊讶的是，关于这一点的研究很少。《经济学人》没有找到活着的祖父母的可靠数据，因此我们请德国马克斯·普朗克人口研究所的Diego Alburez-Gutiérrez使用每个国家的年龄和人口数据以及亲属关系结构的模型，对这些数据进行估计。</p>

<h2 id="原文">原文</h2>
<p>The ratio of grandparents to children is higher than ever before. That has big consequences</p>
<p>The most saccharine song of 1980 was “There’s No One Quite Like Grandma”, performed by the St Winifred’s School choir from Stockport, England. It shot to the top of the British charts as kids everywhere gave it to granny for Christmas. “Grandma, we love you,” they sang. “Grandma, we do. Though you may be far away, we think of you.”</p>
<p>Today, as the once-cherubic choristers start to become grandmas and grandpas themselves, grandparenting has changed dramatically. Two big demographic trends are making nana and gramps more important. First, people are living longer. Global life expectancy has risen from 51 to 72 since 1960. Second, families are shrinking. Over the same period, the number of babies a woman can expect to have in her lifetime has fallen by half, from 5 to 2.4. That means the ratio of living grandparents to children is steadily rising.</p>
<p>Surprisingly little research has been done into this. <em>The Economist</em> could not find reliable figures for how many living grandparents there are, so we asked Diego Alburez-Gutiérrez of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany to produce some estimates by crunching un age and population data with models of kinship structures in each country.</p>
<p>We found that there are 1.5bn grandparents in the world, up from 0.5bn in 1960 (though the further back one goes, the fuzzier the estimates become). As a share of the population they have risen from 17% to 20%. And the ratio of grandparents to children under 15 has vaulted from 0.46 in 1960 to 0.8 today.</p>
<p>By 2050 we project that there will be 2.1bn grandparents (making up 22% of humanity), and slightly more grandparents than under-15s. That will have profound consequences. The evidence suggests children do better with grandparental help—which usually, in practice, means from grandmothers. And it will help drive another unfinished social revolution—the movement of women into paid work.</p>

</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/11/which-countries-are-driving-the-worlds-population-growth">fertility rates</a> and life expectancy vary enormously from country to country, the age of the grandparent has not yet dawned everywhere (see chart 1). They are 29% of Bulgarians but only 10% of Burundians. Their average age varies widely, too, from 53 in Uganda to 72 in Japan (see chart 2). To understand what a difference plentiful grandparents make, a good place to start is in a country where they are still scarce.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="grandparent_gap.png" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>Consider Senegal. Most rural Senegalese are subsistence farmers. Although fertility has dropped from 7.3 babies per woman in 1980 to 4.5 today, large families remain the norm. Children under 15 outnumber living grandparents by 3.5 to 1.</p>
<p>Amy Diallo, an 84-year-old matriarch wrapped in a blue and white hijab, has to think carefully when asked how many she has. “Thirty,” she concludes, looking up from her cross-legged position on the floor of her home in Tally Boubess, outside Dakar, the capital, on a street where horses and carts jostle with sheep and cars.</p>
<p>As the oldest member of her family, she commands respect. She offers moral guidance to the young: be honest and pious, uphold tradition and stop hitting your younger brother. Every year she leads a family pilgrimage to Tivaouane, a Muslim holy city, with children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and various in-laws, perhaps a hundred in all.</p>
<p>Grandparents pass on traditional beliefs, stories, songs and a sense of history. More prosaically, they bring an extra pair of hands. That helps both parents and children. A study in rural Gambia, for example, found that the presence of a maternal grandmother significantly increased a child’s chance of living to the age of two. In sub-Saharan Africa the odds of being in school are about 15% higher for children living with a grandfather and 38% higher for children who live with a grandmother.</p>
<p>As for Mrs Diallo, she has never worked outside the home. But she has helped some of her offspring to do so. Ndeye, one of her daughters, got a job in an office despite having eight kids herself, because Mrs Diallo helped out with the children.</p>
<p>Yet for all her sense of love and duty, Mrs Diallo cannot babysit all 30 grandkids. The state offers little help. Unlike Ndeye, many of Mrs Diallo’s daughters and granddaughters have never worked outside the home. This is common: barely a third of working-age women in Senegal are either in work or seeking it. Grandparents in the poorest countries do their best, but there are not enough of them.</p>
<h2 id="shes-there-in-times-of-need">She’s there in times of need</h2>
<p>In richer places, fertility has fallen much further than in Africa. A typical <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2010/04/22/when-the-ninos-run-out">Mexican woman</a>, for example, can expect to have only two children, down from nearly seven in 1960. Mexico’s ratio of living grandparents to children is three times higher than Senegal’s. Mexican <em>abuelas</em> thus have more time to lavish on each grandchild.</p>
<p>Irma Aguilar Verduzco lives with her daughter, also called Irma, and two grandchildren, Rodrigo and Fernanda. She cooks, does school runs and reads with her grandchildren. Ever since he was three, Rodrigo, now 16, has liked to take a cup of coffee and sit down for a chat with his grandmother. Fernanda, now 12, still likes to get into bed with her. Irma junior, meanwhile, has long worked 12-hour days, currently as a manager at the Maya Train, a big rail project. She is divorced, and says her ex-husband “does not help”. She “could not have done anything” without Irma senior’s help.</p>
<p>Grandmothers are the main source of non-parental child care for young children in Mexico, especially since covid-19 forced many nurseries to close. They watch over nearly 40% of sprogs under six. Before grandma moved in, Irma was struggling. “There is no understanding or flexibility for working mothers in Mexico,” she complains. Her kids were often home alone. “Sometimes I paid people to look after them but it was hard to afford and hard to trust people.” One day, years ago, Rodrigo came home from nursery with a broken bone; Irma suspects mistreatment. With her mother around, she feels relaxed.</p>
<p>Miguel Talamas of the Inter-American Development Bank and his colleagues have tried to estimate how much Mexican grandmothers help their daughters get paid work. They looked at what happened to families after grandmothers die. An <em>abuela</em>’s death reduced by 27%, or 12 percentage points, the chance that her daughter was in the labour force, and reduced her earnings by 53%. (The same study found no effect on the employment rate of fathers.)</p>
<p>Living with grandparents is not always easy. They may have outdated ideas or demand too much deference. In India, where couples traditionally live with the husband’s parents, a genre of television drama turns on the fraught relations between wives and mothers-in-law. A study of rural Indian women in 2018 found that those who lived with their <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2013/12/21/curse-of-the-mummyji"><em>mummyji</em></a> (mother-in-law) had little freedom. Only 12% were allowed to visit friends or relatives alone.</p>
<p>A grandma who enforces old-fashioned norms of wifely subjugation can make it harder for her daughter-in-law to work outside the home. But an intriguing study finds that on average, this effect is outweighed by the help the mother-in-law gives with domestic chores. Such help has become more concentrated as India’s fertility rate has fallen, from six in 1960 to just over two today. Madhulika Khanna of Amazon and Divya Pandey of 3ie, a think-tank, looked at what happened to Indian women if <em>mummyji</em> died. They found the daughters-in-law were 10% less likely to do or seek paid work, probably because they had to spend more time collecting firewood and minding their children. Even overbearing grandmothers can inadvertently do their bit for female emancipation.</p>
<p>Rich countries generally provide services that help women juggle child-care and work. But many parents seek extra help from grandparents nonetheless. Old-age pensions help, by allowing grandparents to give up work. According to one survey, 50% of very young children, 35% of primary-school-aged children and 20% of teens in America spend time with their grandparent in a typical week.</p>
<p>This can make a big difference. Janice Compton of the University of Manitoba and Robert Pollak of Washington University crunched American census data and found that living within 25 miles of a grandmother raised the labour-force participation rate for married women with small children by 4-10 percentage points.</p>
<p>“Granny nannying”, as some call it, can have downsides, too. A British study found grandparents are more likely to leave their wards near fire hazards than nurseries or nannies. Studies from America, Britain, China and Japan suggest that a child around grandparents is more likely to be obese, though whether this is due to spoiling or other factors is unclear.</p>
<h2 id="to-us-a-book-shell-read">To us a book she’ll read</h2>
<p>And although grandmas help daughters return to the workforce, that often means withdrawing from it themselves. “There is a clear trade-off,” says Mr Talamas. Back in Mexico, Hermelinda Coapango Vázquez works as a manicurist but takes appointments only at times that fit around caring for her grandson. “My grandson is my life,” she says. “I don’t have a partner and I am not one for having lots of friends.” A study from Brazil found that when children aged 0-3 were randomly assigned formal child care, the family collectively earned more, mainly because grandparents and older siblings were freed up to work.</p>
<p>Another pitfall is that families that rely heavily on grandma for child-care are less likely to move and find a better job. A study by Eva Garcia-Moran of the University of Wurzburg and Zoe Kuehn of the Autonomous University of Madrid found that west German women who lived near their parents in-laws earn about 5% less and commute for longer than their peers.</p>
<p>Children parented solely or mostly by grandparents tend to be worse off than their peers. In America, where roughly 2% of children are raised primarily by a grandparent, Laura Pittman of Northern Illinois University found more emotional and behavioural problems among such adolescents than their peers. That is perhaps not surprising. If children are not living with their parents, it is often because something has gone badly wrong: a father in jail; a mother dead or incapable. In these circumstances, living with a grandparent is usually far better than the alternatives.</p>
<p>Katie Clark, a 68-year-old from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has had sole custody of one grandchild and has temporarily cared for five others because of her daughter’s addiction to opiates. She took charge of her daughter’s first baby soon after she was born. About 12 years later, the daughter arrived, homeless, with five more. She abandoned her children in Katie’s home, before returning with police to demand them back. The daughter currently has custody of the five children, and Katie fears she is neglecting them again. The child raised entirely by Katie is now at university.</p>
<p>In rural China, grandparents help reduce the harm caused by the government. Under the apartheid-like <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/22/reforms-to-chinas-hukou-system-will-not-help-migrants-much"><em>hukou</em></a> (household registration) system, rural Chinese who move to cities are treated as second-class citizens. Their children are barred from local public schools, so they are often left behind with their grandparents in their parents’ home village. But rural schools are often dire. Grandparents, though well-meaning, are often barely literate. Scott Rozelle of Stanford University finds that more than half of toddlers in rural China are cognitively delayed, partly because their grandparents do not realise that it is important to talk to them.</p>
<h2 id="just-stays-a-little-while">Just stays a little while</h2>
<p>Overall, looking after kids appears to be good for grandparents. Those who spend time with their grandchildren report lower levels of depression and loneliness. But one can have too much of a good thing. Youngsters can be exhausting, frustrating and objectionable. A study in Singapore, with mainly ethnically Chinese families, found that many looked after their grandchildren more out of duty than because they relished it. Many find it harder as they age. Some are squeezed in the “grandsandwich generation”—relied upon to help both their grandchildren and their own ailing parents. Some hanker for a more relaxing retirement. Grandma Irma in Mexico admits she would like to travel more as her grandchildren grow more independent.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="retirement.png" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>One place where grandparents have plenty of time to relax is Sweden, where a strong welfare state means parents seldom rely on them. For each child, a Swedish couple can take 16 months of parental leave, for most of which the state pays them most of their previous wages. (The man must take three months, or they are lost; many split the time off equally.) Afterwards, there are subsidised nurseries, and the norm is for both parents to go back to work. Since child-care is everywhere, Swedes find it relatively easy to move cities to find a better job.</p>
<p>“Once in a while a grandparent might pick up a kid from pre-school or babysit, but not always,” says Andreas Bergh of Lund university. Rather than allow a daughter to go back to work, grandparents might enable her to go out to dinner with her husband. Grandparental help is “a bonus”, says Andreas Heino of Timbro, a think-tank in Stockholm.</p>
<p>A lot on her plate</p>
<p>Subsidies for parental leave are so generous that even entrepreneurs take a fair chunk of it. Sandra Kastås runs two companies in Stockholm. When her son was born in 2021 she took two months off, then spent a year working half-time, as did her husband, an it specialist. Despite her hectic schedule, Mrs Kastås expects no regular help from her parents. They live on Gotland, a remote island, and do not visit often. Her mother “shows her love by sending gifts”, such as books and jumpers she has knitted. She talks to her grandson, on FaceTime. “He hugs the phone when she calls. It’s cute,” says Mrs Kastås.</p>
<p>Most Swedes are happy with their system. But some of the elderly <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/01/22/how-does-it-really-feel-to-be-lonely">complain of loneliness</a>. Nearly half of Swedish households consist of one person, the highest level in Europe after Finland. In a population of 10.4m, some 900,000 people are over 60 and living alone. Of these, a fifth are considered socially isolated, meaning they do not meet friends or family more than twice a month. During the pandemic, Swedes joked darkly that it would be easy to isolate the elderly because “We don’t visit our grandparents much anyway.” Immigrants from places such as Africa or the Middle East are often shocked at how atomised Swedish families are.</p>
<p>Lars Tragardh, a historian, praises Sweden’s “statist individualism”. The state looks after people as individuals, so they can make their own choices and not have to rely on others, he says. Parents elsewhere envy the help that their Nordic peers receive, despite the higher taxes needed to pay for it. Still, even the most generous welfare state cannot offer love.</p>
<p>Helena Paues, who works for an association of local authorities in Sweden, describes how her father enjoys taking her dyslexic son, Wille, to museums. “He loves facts and science. I think his grandfather has taken him to all the museums in Stockholm: the science museum, the Viking museum, and so on. They have a very close bond. My father also struggled with learning to read and write when he was young.”</p>
<p>In the summer, the grandkids stay at their grandparents’ summer house, swim in the lake, and drink lemonade in a tree house. They clamour to do the same thing every year. Ms Paues says her father instils values such as respect for others. “He doesn’t need to talk about it, he does it by being himself. He teaches them that their opinions matter, because he listens to them.” She concludes: “As a child, you need more grown-ups than just your parents.”</p>

<p>​             心理治疗师题材的电影是一种非常有教育意义的影片，它可以帮助人们更好地了解心理治疗的过程以及它如何有助于我们改善心理健康。这类电影往往通过生动形象的方式，向观众展示了心理治疗如何帮助人们解决心理问题，从而改善生活质量。</p>
<p>《心灵捕手》中的心理医生尚恩是一个非常出色的人物形象。他拥有极高的职业素养和专业知识，能够帮助病人治疗心理问题。同时，他还具有极高的同理心和耐心，能够倾听病人的心声，帮助他们解决困扰。在影片中，他的形象既有力又温柔，让人印象深刻。</p>
<p>​       这篇文章讨论了关于心理治疗师在电影和电视上的形象的问题。从1906年的“Dr Dippy’s Sanitarium”到2022年的“The Responder”，心理治疗师一直在电影和电视剧中出现，但是一些心理治疗师对于他们的工作被虚构描绘感到不安。Sally Brown是英国咨询与心理治疗协会的成员，她说：“对于那些需要帮助的客户来说，他们对治疗有一个现实的了解是非常重要的，好的治疗不会制造好的戏剧。”她希望观众足够明智，能够识别出哪些内容是为了戏剧效果而夸张的，特别是对于不称职的专业人员的描绘是无效的。</p>

<h2 id="原文">原文</h2>
<p>In 1924 a Hollywood producer offered Sigmund Freud $100,000 (around $1.7m today) to work on a project about great love stories in history. Freud declined. He ignored an Austrian director, too, who wanted psychoanalysts to help with a silent movie about a scientist with a phobia of knives. Freud thought film-making and therapy were difficult to reconcile: the risk of sensationalism was too high.</p>
<p>Commissioners and television executives have not minded Freud’s concerns: fictional and real therapists crop up frequently on screens, from “Shrinking” (pictured top) to “The Patient” and “Couples Therapy” to “Stutz”. “Before”, a limited series, is in the works at Apple tv+; it stars Billy Crystal as a child psychiatrist. “Blue Therapy”, a YouTube reality show on which young couples discuss their troubles with a therapist, has been adapted for television and will air on E4, a British free-to-air channel, later this year. “Freud’s Last Session”, a film starring Anthony Hopkins, will begin production soon.</p>
<p>Screenwriters have long used psychiatrists as a narrative tool. In their book “Psychiatry and the Cinema”, Glen Gabbard, a psychiatrist, and Krin Gabbard, an academic specialising in film studies, said a therapist often functions as what <a href="https://www.economist.com/review/1998/12/10/understanding-henry">Henry James</a>, a 19th-century English writer, called a <em>ficelle</em>: a character who holds the metaphorical marionette strings that orchestrate the plot. The encounter between analyst and patient can provide colour and context, as their conversations prompt characters to think back over their lives, recollections sometimes dramatised as flashbacks. Therapy sessions can also provide moments of epiphany for a protagonist. For the viewer, the revelatory feeling can echo the satisfaction felt when a detective solves a crime.</p>
<p>One of the earliest portrayals of the profession, a silent comedy film called “Dr Dippy’s Sanitarium” (1906), features a clinician who treats patients by offering them pies. In <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/04/08/presenting-alfred-hitchcock-elusive-genius">Alfred Hitchcock</a>’s “Spellbound” (1945), Ingrid Bergman played a psychoanalyst trying to assess whether her new colleague and love interest (Gregory Peck) is a murderer suffering from amnesia. In “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (1975) Dean Brooks, the real-life boss of the psychiatric hospital where the film was made, played a small role as a doctor at the fictional institution. Brooks apparently had no concerns about the film damaging his profession’s reputation.</p>
<p>Today, many therapists are uneasy about fictionalisations of their work. “It’s important that clients who need help have a realistic idea of what therapy is and what it isn’t,” says Sally Brown, a counsellor and member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (bacp). “Good therapy does not make good drama.” She hopes that audiences are astute enough to know when something is exaggerated for dramatic purposes; she is most concerned by portrayals in which an inept professional’s treatment is ineffective. For example, “The Responder”, a bbc police drama of 2022, featured an amenable but useless therapist who treats her job like “a tick-box exercise”, says Ms Brown.</p>
<p>In “The Patient”, a recent show, Steve Carell plays a therapist whose client locks him in a basement and demands to be cured of his murderous compulsions. The character excels at what he does and conjures the illusion of professionalism in testing circumstances. By contrast, Jimmy Laird (Jason Segel), the protagonist of “Shrinking”, Apple tv+’s newest—and disappointingly dull—comedy series, is a very bad therapist. Grieving his dead wife, he ditches the guiding rules of his profession and decides to become a “psychological vigilante”. He tells one patient to leave her husband or he’ll stop treating her and invites another, an ex-soldier, to live in his outhouse. Ms Brown thinks “The Sopranos” provides an exemplary depiction of therapy. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) gives <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/10/01/where-tony-soprano-really-comes-from">Tony Soprano</a> wise counsel and understands his nature. After she is attacked in a car park, Melfi chooses not to tell the mob boss the name of her assailant, knowing he would exact merciless revenge on her behalf.</p>
<p>Some documentaries about psychotherapy profess to be educational. “Couples Therapy” (pictured above) shows real-life couples in therapy with Orna Guralnik, a star psychoanalyst. In “Stutz” Jonah Hill, an American actor, explores his relationship with his psychiatrist, Phil Stutz. But, even in this format, professional boundaries are muddled; confidentiality is obliterated. Once the camera is turned on, “you’re performing”, says Denise Freeman, a psychotherapist and bacp member who has worked in television. “You have to question how much is real and how comfortable the client is.”</p>
<p>Despite these ethical questions, the shrink will continue to appeal to screenwriters, producers and audiences alike: thanks to the pandemic and the economic downturn, viewers are both more unhappy and more open about that unhappiness. In 2020 depression and anxiety increased by <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2021/12/11/dramatic-growth-in-mental-health-apps-has-created-a-risky-industry">more than 25%</a> globally, according to the <em>Lancet</em>, a medical journal. In 2010 a fifth of British people said they had turned to a counsellor; by 2022 a third had. Perhaps peeking inside a fictional consultation room may inspire some viewers to hop onto the couch themselves.</p>

<p>​       人类一直未停止寻找外星人，其中最著名的 SETI 计划，是唯一由官方牵头，寻找外星人的计划。</p>
<p>​       文章指出：墨西哥州的Very Large Array (VLA)射电天文台将开始将其所有收集到的数据发送给cosmic，这是一个专门用于搜寻外星生物智慧的计算机集群。自去年 12 月以来，南非的Meerkat天文台也使用了类似的系统。在接下来的两年中，VLA单独将对 4 千万星星进行观察。计算机还将从以前的射电和可见光频率调查中挖掘数据，寻找任何不属于地球的不自然物。如果银河系中有许多高度发达的文明，并发出强烈的信号，这可能是一种正确的方法。</p>

<h2 id="原文">原文</h2>
<p>This month the vla (Very Large Array) radio-astronomy observatory in New Mexico will begin sending every bit of data it harvests for astronomers’ research projects to cosmic, a computer cluster dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (seti). A similar system has been piggybacking on the Meerkat observatory in South Africa (pictured) since December.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, the vla alone will cast an eye over 40m stars. Computers will also be mining data from past surveys, in radio frequencies and in visible light, for anything that seems both unnatural and not from Earth, says James Davenport, an astronomer at the University of Washington who works with such surveys.</p>
<p>If there are many technologically advanced civilisations in the galaxy, emitting powerful signals, this might well be the right approach, according to Steve Croft of the University of California, Berkeley. Some of them will then be where users of the vla happen to be looking. Either that, or they will be close enough to be detectable from existing survey data.</p>
<p>But if extraterrestrial civilisations are rare, and thus mostly far away, or if they rarely broadcast with a lot of power, they will be found only by selecting promising sources in advance and staring at them for a long time. This is done by the Green Bank Telescope, a large radio dish in West Virginia, for which the Berkeley seti Research Centre has contracted 20% of the observing time, with Dr Croft as project scientist.</p>
<p>Dr Davenport and Dr Croft were both addressing a session on detecting extraterrestrial intelligences at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, held in Seattle from January 8th-12th. This is a field that goes in and out of fashion, but at the moment fortune is smiling on it in the form of the Breakthrough Listen project, paid for by Yuri Milner, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist.</p>
<p>Breakthrough Listen, which began in 2016, is scheduled to last for ten years, and will disburse $100m over that period. The money is paying for observations by the Green Bank Telescope, Meerkat, the Parkes radio observatory in Australia and the Automated Planet Finder telescope at the Lick Observatory in California.</p>
<p>A question preoccupying Dr Croft is how to select Green Bank’s targets. One answer is to try to get inside et’s head (or equivalent brain-containing part of the anatomy). Starting from the assumption (admittedly generous) that there are beings out there who actively wish to talk to their galactic neighbours, how would they go about it?</p>
<p>As luck would have it, one obvious approach does et-seekers’ work for them. A good way to discover planets orbiting other stars is by looking for transits—brief diminutions in the light from a star caused by a planet passing in front of it, as seen from Earth. So far 3,941 planets orbiting other stars have been discovered that way. This method would also be obvious to extraterrestrial intelligences, and it would make sense for them to concentrate their broadcasts on planets they have discovered. For Earthbound seekers after aliens, this means they have to orient their antennas towards the Earth Transit Zone, a band across the sky from which Earth could be seen to transit the sun. Directing his telescope at planets known of in that zone would be a good gambit for Dr Croft.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is that garrulous ets might use supernovae to flag transmissions. That, Dr Davenport explained, might work like this. An extraterrestrial intelligence which wanted to make itself known would broadcast high-power signals of its existence every time its astronomers observed a supernova—and then wait.</p>
<p>What happens next is a complicated geometrical dance. Two wavefronts of electromagnetic radiation—one from the supernova and one from the et—are now spreading through space at the speed of light. For most potential listeners, they would arrive at different times, depending on their location with respect to both.</p>
<p><strong>Galactic semaphore</strong></p>
<p>It would make no sense for those seeking their galactic neighbours to start listening precisely when they saw a supernova, for they would not know where to look for any signal that might have been sent in response to it. But what such listeners, including those on Earth, could do, is go back to their archives and choose a supernova they saw in the past, say 1,000 years ago. The next step would be to see if there are any stars for which the time the supernova signal would take to travel there, plus the time for the broadcast it may have triggered to travel to Earth, would add up to 1,000 years as well. Those would be the stars from which signals could potentially be arriving at that moment.</p>
<p>As he told the meeting, Andy Nilipour of Yale University has been doing just this for supernovae described in 1054 by Chinese astronomers, in 1572 by Tycho Brahe, in 1604 by Johannes Kepler and in 1987 by many, many astronomers. Using data from Gaia, an orbiting observatory belonging to the European Space Agency, he is able to measure the locations of many stars with a precision of a few light-years. He has found 465 that fit the bill.</p>
<p>Such a level of precision is available, though, only for stars that are fairly close by. A complementary approach, proposed recently by Seto Naoki of Kyoto University, overcomes that by looking not at stars a certain distance from a supernova, but in a certain direction relative to it.</p>
<p>This would, Dr Seto outlined in a paper he published in 2021, work somewhat like a rugby player passing the ball to another who is running at full tilt. At any given time, there is a special direction to throw the ball, so that it will arrive while moving at right angles to the direction of the receiving player. In a similar way, you can at any particular moment find a special direction for two planets and a supernova. With luck, both parties will know to look in that direction to make contact. Mr Nilipour has also found 403 stars for which this approach would work, for a total of 868 between the two methods.</p>
<p>These approaches do, though, depend on et wishing to be found. Other civilisations may be shy, or simply not care. It may nevertheless be possible to discover where they are hiding.</p>
<p>In 2013, Andrew Siemion, who now works at the seti Institute, a non-profit organisation that has been active in the alien-searching business since 1984, proposed looking for systems where planets not only transit their star as viewed from Earth, but also regularly occult each other, which means two of them line up precisely in the direction of Earth. If both were inhabited by members of the same intelligent species, one having been settled from the other, they would presumably be in communication. That would require fairly powerful signals—and in this case they would be aimed in exactly the right direction to travel onward to Earth.</p>
<p>Evan Sneed of the University of California, Riverside, Sofia Sheikh of the seti Institute, and Nick Tusay of Penn State University are now doing the calculations for 60 promising systems where transits happen, to work out a calendar for observing them. So far, they have looked at seven.</p>
<p>Mr Tusay also told the conference about his search for extraterrestrial probes in the solar system. That such things exist is an even longer shot than looking for radio signals from afar. But that, in the view of seti enthusiasts, is not a reason not to try.</p>
<p>The question is, where to scout around? In principle, such probes could be anywhere. But there are places where they might be especially useful to their owners. These are where the sun’s gravity would concentrate light or radio waves from particular nearby star systems. It is easy to calculate that any signal from, say, Alpha Centauri, would be enhanced along a line pointing away from the sun in opposition to that star system, starting 550 times as far from the sun as Earth is.</p>
<p>That Alpha Centauri or any other nearby star system is home to an et is the longest of long shots. But, doubling down on what such civilisations might be capable of, Mr Tusay suggests probes like this might be relay stations, passing signals on to others in communication with other systems. This would make the solar system a node in a galactic internet of sorts.</p>
<p>Such probes might also exchange signals with counterparts in the centre of the solar system, closer to Earth, keeping an eye on what was happening there. That means those signals might be detectable.</p>
<p>Mr Tusay looked for such signals with the Green Bank Telescope, but found none. However, in the grand tradition of seti research, the motto of which seems to be “never give up”, this has not made him discard the idea just yet. Probes like this might communicate in ways no one has looked at or even thought of, or maybe they happened to be silent when the observations were done.</p>
<p><strong>Spiders, but not from Mars</strong></p>
<p>Carmen Choza of the Berkeley seti Research Centre, meanwhile, presented the results of a so-far fruitless search for beacons not in nearby star systems in the Milky Way, Earth’s home galaxy, but in 97 others. To be detectable from such distances any radio broadcasts would have had to be unbelievably powerful—and so presumably produced by civilisations that can harness the power of whole stars.</p>
<p>An intelligent species with such energy requirements would have a hard time hiding, if it even cared to. It might even become what Clément Vidal, a philosopher, calls a stellivore civilisation. Tapping the power of entire stars would require engineering on a grand scale. Dr Nilipour plans to look in this context at a special kind of star system called a spider pulsar.</p>
<p>Spider pulsars are thought to be neutron stars with a low-mass ordinary star orbiting so close that it is being destroyed by the neutron star’s emissions. Mr Nilipour wants to see if there is anything going on here that might not be quite natural.</p>
<p>His first step will be to spot stars in the growing Gaia catalogue which are on their way to having a close encounter with a spider pulsar. Anything about their relative motion that would require the influence of more than regular gravity would suggest a stellivore preparing to tuck into its next meal. He has already found some semi-promising candidates—in particular, some stars that may fall victim to such attention in 10,000 years or so.</p>
<p>There is no spider pulsar near Earth, fortunately. But such ideas, wild as they are, do raise the question of whether human beings should do more than just listen for signs of et. Talking, albeit with a time delay of decades or even centuries, with other intelligent species would be exhilarating. But if it involved organisms with that sort of power, it might also be pretty dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="原文">原文</h2>
<p>以下是<strong>原文</strong>以及<strong>雅思词汇解析</strong>：</p>
<p>The brave new world Aldous Huxley describes in his novel of that title features the “feelies”. In 1932, its year of publication, movies were turning into talkies. Feelies must have seemed a logical, if creepy, extension of that. The book alludes to a film at a local theatre with a love scene on a bearskin rug, in which the sensation of every hair of the bear is reproduced.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="feelies.jpg" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>The feelies have still not arrived. But people are working on them. In computer games and virtual reality (vr), two heirs to cinema’s role in light entertainment, practitioners of the discipline of haptics are attempting to add a sense of touch to those of vision and hearing, to <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/01/researchers-find-a-way-to-make-vr-headsets-more-realistic">increase the illusion of immersion in a virtual world</a>. In future, they hope, if you reach out to pluck an apple from a tree in such a paradise, your hand will no longer go through it. You will, rather, be able to feel and grasp the fruit, if not actually eat it. Conversely, if it is a paradise lost you are in, and a baddy hiding behind the apple tree shoots you, you will feel the bullet’s impact.</p>
<p>To experience all this a user will wear haptic clothing. The ambitious talk of whole-body haptic suits, but in the case of the apple, the tree and the gunman haptic gloves and a haptic vest would suffice. Moving a gloved hand creates corresponding movement of a user’s virtual hand, with sensations appropriate to objects “touched” being fed back via devices called haptic actuators, incorporated into the glove. Haptic vests similarly stimulate parts of the upper body.</p>
<p><strong>Hand in glove</strong></p>
<p>Actuators themselves come in a variety of forms. Those most widely used at the moment are erms (eccentric rotating masses) and lras (linear resonant actuators). An erm is a tiny motor that drives a shaft fitted with an off-centre weight which causes the whole thing to vibrate when the shaft spins. An lra uses an electromagnetic coil to shake a surface. Nowadays, these devices are employed for jobs like alerting smartphone users to incoming messages and reacting when a touchscreen is tapped. But adapting such well-understood technologies for use in vr and gaming should be fairly easy.</p>
<p>erms and lrass are not, however, the only possible approaches to immersive haptics. For instance, owo Game, a Spanish firm, is about to put on sale a haptic vest, worn next to the skin, that relies on electrical stimulation rather than vibrating actuators. It delivers tuneable levels of current to different parts of the torso. Besides creating tingling sensations, these can also cause muscles to contract. Effects replicable using this approach apparently include being shot, stabbed and blown up.</p>
<p>In Redmond, Washington, meanwhile, a firm called HaptX has reached for pneumatics, a technology many might think had seen its heyday. Bob Crockett, one of the company’s founders, explains that the firm needs compressed air to produce a big enough displacement of the skin to effect a realistic sensation of touch. Other haptic devices, he says, cannot do that.</p>
<p>HaptX’s gloves, branded g1, have their air pumped in and out through a network of tubes which inflate or deflate 135 tiny balloons incorporated into each glove. The most sensitive of these balloons—those in the finger tips—are less than 1mm in diameter. The gloves’ fingers also include pneumatic “exotendons”, which brake the fingers’ movement, thereby simulating the feeling of touching a solid object. The compressor and electronics powering the system are held in a backpack, so a user can move around freely.</p>
<p>None of this will be cheap. A pair of g1 gloves will set you back at least $4,500. The initial market, though, is corporate, rather than retail. Early customers are expected to include organisations that already use vr for training and want to improve the experience: medical schools teaching operating techniques to surgeons, for example, or workshops that repair jet engines. Another use might be to permit collaboration between engineers living in different parts of the world. People working on a new car, say, could meet in a virtual laboratory, tinker with virtual components, and pass around virtual copies of their designs.</p>
<p>There is, though, a further reason why HaptX has chosen pneumatics: it does not intend to stop at making gloves. It has plans for a whole-body haptic suit and thinks pneumatic actuation will be easier to scale up than something based on electric motors. It is cagey about details, but users would don an exoskeleton that could create sensations all over the body—including forces that pull a user’s hands downward, so he or she would feel the weight of virtual objects.</p>
<p><strong>Unvested interest</strong></p>
<p>vr and gaming are the high end of haptics. But ways of improving haptic feedback in the non-virtual world are important, too. Smartphones, computers and the touchscreens now proliferating in vehicles, fast-food venues and so on could all benefit from a bit of haptic feedback.</p>
<p>Aito, a firm based in Amsterdam, hopes to provide just that. It produces haptic systems for laptops and other digital devices. These employ actuators based on piezoelectric materials, which shrink or expand in response to a voltage, producing a slight movement. And the process works in reverse, as well. When squeezed, a piezoelectric crystal generates a current. This means piezo materials can be employed both as actuators and as sensors.</p>
<p>Aito’s actu-sensors have three layers. Their covers are plastic, glass or even wood. Below lies a capacitance grid, which determines, from the change created in the grid’s electric field, the position of a finger touching the device. The third layer is a matrix of piezo activators. All three combine into something barely 1.8mm thick that can be incorporated into touchscreens and touch pads.</p>
<p>When an actu-sensor detects a finger it responds appropriately, according to the position and pressure of the digit in question. It might create clicks. Or rumbles. Or form the screen’s upper layer into a stable but scratchy surface that would cause a finger or a plastic stylus to feel like a fountain pen gliding over paper, or like a brush painting on canvas.</p>
<p>With the introduction of portable devices that have foldable screens, the lower half might thereby be used as a haptic keyboard. It could be programmed to provide a tactile response like that of a mechanical keyboard, but with additional features, says Nedko Ivanov, Aito’s boss. For instance, pressing down harder would capitalise a letter, doing away with the need for a shift key.</p>
<p>This would also allow devices to be slimmer and lighter. And the same machine could be sold in different places without having to modify its hardware, for a screen-based haptic keyboard could be programmed to use whatever character set was appropriate to the local language.</p>
<p>Some of these new features will work their way into cars, too—especially as conventional dashboard switches are replaced more and more by icons on a screen. Without a satisfying mechanical click, it can be hard to tell, without taking your eyes off the road, whether such icons have been activated or deactivated.</p>
<p>And there is also one other potentially big use for haptics. Pornographers were early pioneers of the internet (and, indeed, of film and photography before that). So it is hardly surprising a number of them are now working on virtual-sex encounters—known in the trade as “teledildonics”. Some companies producing sex toys, for example, have already begun adding Bluetooth-enabled items to their range, allowing couples to link up remotely, as it were. Perhaps Huxley wasn’t so far off the money after all.</p>

<h2 id="原文">原文</h2>
<p>以下是 <strong>原文</strong> 以及 <strong>雅思词汇解析</strong> ：</p>
<p>Every so often a technology captures the world’s imagination. The latest example, judging by the chatter in Silicon Valley, on Wall Street, in corner offices, newsrooms and classrooms around the world, is <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/08/how-good-is-chatgpt">Chatgpt</a>. In five days after its unveiling in November the artificially intelligent chatbot, created by a startup called Openai, drew 1m users, making it one of the fastest consumer-product launches in history. <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/25/how-will-satya-nadella-handle-microsofts-chatgpt-moment">Microsoft</a>, which has just invested $10bn in Openai, wants Chatgpt-like powers, which include generating text, images and video that seem like they could have been created by humans, to infuse much of the software it sells. On January 26th Google published a paper describing a similar model that can create music from a text description of a song. Investors in Alphabet, its parent company, are listening out for its answer to Chatgpt. Baidu, a Chinese search giant, reportedly plans to add a chatbot to its search engine in March.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/883/90/media-assets/image/20230204_WBC930.png" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>It is too early to say how much of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/06/artificial-intelligence-is-permeating-business-at-last">early hype</a> is justified. Regardless of the extent to which the “generative” ai models behind Chatgpt and its rivals transform business, culture and society, however, they are already transforming how the tech industry thinks about innovation and its engines—the corporate research labs that, like Openai and Google Research, are combining big tech’s processing power with the brain power of some of computer science’s brightest sparks. These rival labs—be they part of big tech firms, affiliated with them or run by independent startups—are engaged in an epic race for ai supremacy (see chart 1). The result of that race will determine how quickly the age of ai will dawn for computer users everywhere—and who will dominate it.</p>
<p>Corporate research-and-development (r&amp;d) organisations have long been a source of scientific advances, especially in America. A century and a half ago Thomas Edison used the proceeds from his inventions, including the phonograph and the lightbulb, to bankroll his workshop in Menlo Park, New Jersey. After the second world war, America Inc invested heavily in basic science in the hope that this would yield practical products. DuPont (a maker of chemicals), ibm and Xerox (which both manufactured hardware) all housed big research laboratories. at&amp;t’s Bell Labs produced, among other inventions, the transistor, laser and the photovoltaic cell, earning its researchers nine Nobel prizes.</p>
<p>In the late 20th century, though, corporate r&amp;d became steadily less about the r than the d. In 2017 Ashish Arora, an economist, and colleagues examined the period from 1980 to 2006 and found that firms had moved away from basic science towards developing existing ideas. The reason, Mr Arora and his co-authors argued, was the rising cost of research and the increasing difficulty of capturing its fruits. Xerox developed the icons and windows now familiar to computer-users but it was Apple and Microsoft that made most of the money from it. Science remained important to innovation, but it became the dominion of not-for-profit universities.</p>
<p>The rise of ai is shaking things up once again. Big corporations are not the only game in town. Startups such as Anthropic and Character ai have built their own Chatgpt challengers. Stability ai, a startup that has assembled a consortium of small firms, universities and non-profits to pool computing resources, has created a popular open-source model that converts text to images. In China, government-backed outfits such as the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (baai) are pre-eminent.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1430/90/media-assets/image/20230204_WBC567.png" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>But almost all recent breakthroughs in big ai globally have come from giant companies, because they have the computing power (see chart 2), and because this is a rare area where results of basic research can be rapidly incorporated into products. Amazon, whose ai powers its Alexa voice assistant, and Meta, which made waves recently when one of its models beat human players at “Diplomacy”, a strategy board game, respectively produce two-thirds and four-fifths as much ai research as Stanford University, a bastion of computer-science eggheads. Alphabet and Microsoft churn out considerably more, and that is not including <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/03/01/deepmind-and-google-the-battle-to-control-artificial-intelligence">DeepMind</a>, Google Research’s sister lab which the parent company acquired in 2014, and the Microsoft-affiliated Openai (see chart 3).</p>
<p>Expert opinion varies on who is actually ahead on the merits. The Chinese labs, for example, appear to have a big lead in the subdiscipline of computer vision, which involves analysing images, where they are responsible for the largest share of the most highly cited papers. According to a ranking devised by Microsoft, the top five computer-vision teams in the world are <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/10/13/china-and-the-west-are-in-a-race-to-foster-innovation">all Chinese</a>. The baai has also built what it says is the world’s biggest natural-language model, Wu Dao 2.0. Meta’s “Diplomacy” player, Cicero, gets kudos for its use of strategic reasoning and deception against human opponents. DeepMind’s models have beat human champions at Go, a notoriously difficult board game, and can predict the shape of proteins, a long-standing challenge in the life sciences.</p>
<p>Jaw-dropping feats, all. When it comes to the sort of ai that is all the rage thanks to Chatgpt, though, the big battle is between Microsoft and Alphabet. To see whose tech is superior, <em>The Economist</em> has put both firms’ ais through their paces. With the help of an engineer at Google, we asked Chatgpt, based on an Openai model called gpt-3.5, and Google’s yet-to-be-launched chatbot, built upon one called Lamda, a set of questions. These included ten problems from an American maths competition (“Find the number of ordered pairs of prime numbers that sum to 60”) and ten reading questions from America’s sat school-leavers’ exam (“Read the passage and determine which choice best describes what happens in it”). To spice things up, we also asked each model for dating advice (“Given the following conversation from a dating app, what is the best way to ask someone out on a first date?”).</p>
<p>Neither ai emerged as clearly superior. Google’s was slightly better at maths, answering five questions correctly, compared with three for Chatgpt. Their dating advice was uneven: fed some real exchanges in a dating app, each gave specific suggestions on one occasion, and platitudes such as “be open minded” and “communicate effectively” on another. Chatgpt, meanwhile, answered nine sat questions correctly compared with seven for its Google rival. It also appeared more responsive to our feedback and got a few questions right on a second try. On January 30th Openai announced an update to Chatgpt improving its maths abilities. When we fed the two ais another ten questions, Lamda again outperformed by two points. But when given a second chance Chatgpt tied.</p>
<p>The reason that, at least so far, no model enjoys an unassailable advantage is that ai knowledge diffuses quickly. Researchers from competing labs “all hang out with each other”, says David Ha of Stability ai. Many, like Mr Ha, who used to work at Google, move between organisations, bringing expertise and experience with them. Moreover, since the best ai brains are scientists at heart, they often made their defection to the private sector conditional on a continued ability to publish their research and present results at conferences. That is partly why Google made public big advances including the “transformer”, a key building block in ai models, giving its rivals a leg-up. (The “t” in Chatgpt stands for transformer.) As a result of all this, reckons Yann LeCun, Meta’s top ai boffin, “Nobody is ahead of anybody else by more than two to six months.”</p>
<p>These are, though, early days. The labs may not remain neck-and-neck for ever. Google has reportedly issued a “code red”, fearing that Chatgpt could boost Microsoft’s rival Bing search engine. Researchers at DeepMind say their firm, which has historically focused on game-playing and science, is putting more resources into language modelling; its chatbot, called Sparrow, may be unveiled this year.</p>
<p>One variable that may help determine the ultimate outcome of the contest is how labs are organised. Openai, a small firm with few revenue streams to protect, may find itself with more latitude than rivals to release products to the public. That in turn is generating tonnes of user data that could make its models better (“reinforcement learning from human feedback”, if you must know)—and thus attract more users.</p>
<p>This early-mover advantage could be self-reinforcing in another way, too. Insiders note that Openai’s rapid progress in recent years has allowed it to poach experts from rivals including DeepMind. To keep up, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta may need to rediscover their ability to move fast and break things—a delicate task given all the regulatory scrutiny they are receiving from governments around the world.</p>
<p>Another deciding factor may be the path of technological development. So far in generative ai, bigger has been better. That has given rich tech giants a huge advantage. But size may not be everything in future. For one thing, there are limits to how big the models can conceivably get. Epoch, a non-profit research institute, estimates that at current rates, big language models will run out of high-quality text on the internet by 2026 (though other less-tapped formats, like video, will remain abundant for a while). More important, as Mr Ha of Stability ai points out, there are ways to fine-tune a model to a specific task that “dramatically reduce the need to scale up”. And novel methods to do more with less are being developed all the time.</p>
<p>The capital flowing into generative-ai startups, which last year collectively raised $2.7bn in 110 deals, suggests that venture capitalists are betting that not all the value will be captured by big tech. Alphabet, Microsoft, their fellow technology titans and the Chinese Communist Party will all try to prove these investors wrong. The ai race is only just getting started.</p>
