<p>Jan 31st 2023 The Economist</p>
<p>​       生活长度增加和家庭规模缩小是导致祖父母变得更加重要的两个大的人口趋势。全球预期寿命从1960年的51岁增加到了72岁，而同期一位女性的预期生育数量则从5个减少到了2.4个。这意味着活着的祖父母与孩子的比例不断增加。</p>
<p>​       令人惊讶的是，关于这一点的研究很少。《经济学人》没有找到活着的祖父母的可靠数据，因此我们请德国马克斯·普朗克人口研究所的Diego Alburez-Gutiérrez使用每个国家的年龄和人口数据以及亲属关系结构的模型，对这些数据进行估计。</p>

<h2 id="原文">原文</h2>
<p>The ratio of grandparents to children is higher than ever before. That has big consequences</p>
<p>The most saccharine song of 1980 was “There’s No One Quite Like Grandma”, performed by the St Winifred’s School choir from Stockport, England. It shot to the top of the British charts as kids everywhere gave it to granny for Christmas. “Grandma, we love you,” they sang. “Grandma, we do. Though you may be far away, we think of you.”</p>
<p>Today, as the once-cherubic choristers start to become grandmas and grandpas themselves, grandparenting has changed dramatically. Two big demographic trends are making nana and gramps more important. First, people are living longer. Global life expectancy has risen from 51 to 72 since 1960. Second, families are shrinking. Over the same period, the number of babies a woman can expect to have in her lifetime has fallen by half, from 5 to 2.4. That means the ratio of living grandparents to children is steadily rising.</p>
<p>Surprisingly little research has been done into this. <em>The Economist</em> could not find reliable figures for how many living grandparents there are, so we asked Diego Alburez-Gutiérrez of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany to produce some estimates by crunching un age and population data with models of kinship structures in each country.</p>
<p>We found that there are 1.5bn grandparents in the world, up from 0.5bn in 1960 (though the further back one goes, the fuzzier the estimates become). As a share of the population they have risen from 17% to 20%. And the ratio of grandparents to children under 15 has vaulted from 0.46 in 1960 to 0.8 today.</p>
<p>By 2050 we project that there will be 2.1bn grandparents (making up 22% of humanity), and slightly more grandparents than under-15s. That will have profound consequences. The evidence suggests children do better with grandparental help—which usually, in practice, means from grandmothers. And it will help drive another unfinished social revolution—the movement of women into paid work.</p>

</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/11/which-countries-are-driving-the-worlds-population-growth">fertility rates</a> and life expectancy vary enormously from country to country, the age of the grandparent has not yet dawned everywhere (see chart 1). They are 29% of Bulgarians but only 10% of Burundians. Their average age varies widely, too, from 53 in Uganda to 72 in Japan (see chart 2). To understand what a difference plentiful grandparents make, a good place to start is in a country where they are still scarce.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="grandparent_gap.png" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>Consider Senegal. Most rural Senegalese are subsistence farmers. Although fertility has dropped from 7.3 babies per woman in 1980 to 4.5 today, large families remain the norm. Children under 15 outnumber living grandparents by 3.5 to 1.</p>
<p>Amy Diallo, an 84-year-old matriarch wrapped in a blue and white hijab, has to think carefully when asked how many she has. “Thirty,” she concludes, looking up from her cross-legged position on the floor of her home in Tally Boubess, outside Dakar, the capital, on a street where horses and carts jostle with sheep and cars.</p>
<p>As the oldest member of her family, she commands respect. She offers moral guidance to the young: be honest and pious, uphold tradition and stop hitting your younger brother. Every year she leads a family pilgrimage to Tivaouane, a Muslim holy city, with children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and various in-laws, perhaps a hundred in all.</p>
<p>Grandparents pass on traditional beliefs, stories, songs and a sense of history. More prosaically, they bring an extra pair of hands. That helps both parents and children. A study in rural Gambia, for example, found that the presence of a maternal grandmother significantly increased a child’s chance of living to the age of two. In sub-Saharan Africa the odds of being in school are about 15% higher for children living with a grandfather and 38% higher for children who live with a grandmother.</p>
<p>As for Mrs Diallo, she has never worked outside the home. But she has helped some of her offspring to do so. Ndeye, one of her daughters, got a job in an office despite having eight kids herself, because Mrs Diallo helped out with the children.</p>
<p>Yet for all her sense of love and duty, Mrs Diallo cannot babysit all 30 grandkids. The state offers little help. Unlike Ndeye, many of Mrs Diallo’s daughters and granddaughters have never worked outside the home. This is common: barely a third of working-age women in Senegal are either in work or seeking it. Grandparents in the poorest countries do their best, but there are not enough of them.</p>
<h2 id="shes-there-in-times-of-need">She’s there in times of need</h2>
<p>In richer places, fertility has fallen much further than in Africa. A typical <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2010/04/22/when-the-ninos-run-out">Mexican woman</a>, for example, can expect to have only two children, down from nearly seven in 1960. Mexico’s ratio of living grandparents to children is three times higher than Senegal’s. Mexican <em>abuelas</em> thus have more time to lavish on each grandchild.</p>
<p>Irma Aguilar Verduzco lives with her daughter, also called Irma, and two grandchildren, Rodrigo and Fernanda. She cooks, does school runs and reads with her grandchildren. Ever since he was three, Rodrigo, now 16, has liked to take a cup of coffee and sit down for a chat with his grandmother. Fernanda, now 12, still likes to get into bed with her. Irma junior, meanwhile, has long worked 12-hour days, currently as a manager at the Maya Train, a big rail project. She is divorced, and says her ex-husband “does not help”. She “could not have done anything” without Irma senior’s help.</p>
<p>Grandmothers are the main source of non-parental child care for young children in Mexico, especially since covid-19 forced many nurseries to close. They watch over nearly 40% of sprogs under six. Before grandma moved in, Irma was struggling. “There is no understanding or flexibility for working mothers in Mexico,” she complains. Her kids were often home alone. “Sometimes I paid people to look after them but it was hard to afford and hard to trust people.” One day, years ago, Rodrigo came home from nursery with a broken bone; Irma suspects mistreatment. With her mother around, she feels relaxed.</p>
<p>Miguel Talamas of the Inter-American Development Bank and his colleagues have tried to estimate how much Mexican grandmothers help their daughters get paid work. They looked at what happened to families after grandmothers die. An <em>abuela</em>’s death reduced by 27%, or 12 percentage points, the chance that her daughter was in the labour force, and reduced her earnings by 53%. (The same study found no effect on the employment rate of fathers.)</p>
<p>Living with grandparents is not always easy. They may have outdated ideas or demand too much deference. In India, where couples traditionally live with the husband’s parents, a genre of television drama turns on the fraught relations between wives and mothers-in-law. A study of rural Indian women in 2018 found that those who lived with their <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2013/12/21/curse-of-the-mummyji"><em>mummyji</em></a> (mother-in-law) had little freedom. Only 12% were allowed to visit friends or relatives alone.</p>
<p>A grandma who enforces old-fashioned norms of wifely subjugation can make it harder for her daughter-in-law to work outside the home. But an intriguing study finds that on average, this effect is outweighed by the help the mother-in-law gives with domestic chores. Such help has become more concentrated as India’s fertility rate has fallen, from six in 1960 to just over two today. Madhulika Khanna of Amazon and Divya Pandey of 3ie, a think-tank, looked at what happened to Indian women if <em>mummyji</em> died. They found the daughters-in-law were 10% less likely to do or seek paid work, probably because they had to spend more time collecting firewood and minding their children. Even overbearing grandmothers can inadvertently do their bit for female emancipation.</p>
<p>Rich countries generally provide services that help women juggle child-care and work. But many parents seek extra help from grandparents nonetheless. Old-age pensions help, by allowing grandparents to give up work. According to one survey, 50% of very young children, 35% of primary-school-aged children and 20% of teens in America spend time with their grandparent in a typical week.</p>
<p>This can make a big difference. Janice Compton of the University of Manitoba and Robert Pollak of Washington University crunched American census data and found that living within 25 miles of a grandmother raised the labour-force participation rate for married women with small children by 4-10 percentage points.</p>
<p>“Granny nannying”, as some call it, can have downsides, too. A British study found grandparents are more likely to leave their wards near fire hazards than nurseries or nannies. Studies from America, Britain, China and Japan suggest that a child around grandparents is more likely to be obese, though whether this is due to spoiling or other factors is unclear.</p>
<h2 id="to-us-a-book-shell-read">To us a book she’ll read</h2>
<p>And although grandmas help daughters return to the workforce, that often means withdrawing from it themselves. “There is a clear trade-off,” says Mr Talamas. Back in Mexico, Hermelinda Coapango Vázquez works as a manicurist but takes appointments only at times that fit around caring for her grandson. “My grandson is my life,” she says. “I don’t have a partner and I am not one for having lots of friends.” A study from Brazil found that when children aged 0-3 were randomly assigned formal child care, the family collectively earned more, mainly because grandparents and older siblings were freed up to work.</p>
<p>Another pitfall is that families that rely heavily on grandma for child-care are less likely to move and find a better job. A study by Eva Garcia-Moran of the University of Wurzburg and Zoe Kuehn of the Autonomous University of Madrid found that west German women who lived near their parents in-laws earn about 5% less and commute for longer than their peers.</p>
<p>Children parented solely or mostly by grandparents tend to be worse off than their peers. In America, where roughly 2% of children are raised primarily by a grandparent, Laura Pittman of Northern Illinois University found more emotional and behavioural problems among such adolescents than their peers. That is perhaps not surprising. If children are not living with their parents, it is often because something has gone badly wrong: a father in jail; a mother dead or incapable. In these circumstances, living with a grandparent is usually far better than the alternatives.</p>
<p>Katie Clark, a 68-year-old from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has had sole custody of one grandchild and has temporarily cared for five others because of her daughter’s addiction to opiates. She took charge of her daughter’s first baby soon after she was born. About 12 years later, the daughter arrived, homeless, with five more. She abandoned her children in Katie’s home, before returning with police to demand them back. The daughter currently has custody of the five children, and Katie fears she is neglecting them again. The child raised entirely by Katie is now at university.</p>
<p>In rural China, grandparents help reduce the harm caused by the government. Under the apartheid-like <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/22/reforms-to-chinas-hukou-system-will-not-help-migrants-much"><em>hukou</em></a> (household registration) system, rural Chinese who move to cities are treated as second-class citizens. Their children are barred from local public schools, so they are often left behind with their grandparents in their parents’ home village. But rural schools are often dire. Grandparents, though well-meaning, are often barely literate. Scott Rozelle of Stanford University finds that more than half of toddlers in rural China are cognitively delayed, partly because their grandparents do not realise that it is important to talk to them.</p>
<h2 id="just-stays-a-little-while">Just stays a little while</h2>
<p>Overall, looking after kids appears to be good for grandparents. Those who spend time with their grandchildren report lower levels of depression and loneliness. But one can have too much of a good thing. Youngsters can be exhausting, frustrating and objectionable. A study in Singapore, with mainly ethnically Chinese families, found that many looked after their grandchildren more out of duty than because they relished it. Many find it harder as they age. Some are squeezed in the “grandsandwich generation”—relied upon to help both their grandchildren and their own ailing parents. Some hanker for a more relaxing retirement. Grandma Irma in Mexico admits she would like to travel more as her grandchildren grow more independent.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="retirement.png" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>One place where grandparents have plenty of time to relax is Sweden, where a strong welfare state means parents seldom rely on them. For each child, a Swedish couple can take 16 months of parental leave, for most of which the state pays them most of their previous wages. (The man must take three months, or they are lost; many split the time off equally.) Afterwards, there are subsidised nurseries, and the norm is for both parents to go back to work. Since child-care is everywhere, Swedes find it relatively easy to move cities to find a better job.</p>
<p>“Once in a while a grandparent might pick up a kid from pre-school or babysit, but not always,” says Andreas Bergh of Lund university. Rather than allow a daughter to go back to work, grandparents might enable her to go out to dinner with her husband. Grandparental help is “a bonus”, says Andreas Heino of Timbro, a think-tank in Stockholm.</p>
<p>A lot on her plate</p>
<p>Subsidies for parental leave are so generous that even entrepreneurs take a fair chunk of it. Sandra Kastås runs two companies in Stockholm. When her son was born in 2021 she took two months off, then spent a year working half-time, as did her husband, an it specialist. Despite her hectic schedule, Mrs Kastås expects no regular help from her parents. They live on Gotland, a remote island, and do not visit often. Her mother “shows her love by sending gifts”, such as books and jumpers she has knitted. She talks to her grandson, on FaceTime. “He hugs the phone when she calls. It’s cute,” says Mrs Kastås.</p>
<p>Most Swedes are happy with their system. But some of the elderly <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/01/22/how-does-it-really-feel-to-be-lonely">complain of loneliness</a>. Nearly half of Swedish households consist of one person, the highest level in Europe after Finland. In a population of 10.4m, some 900,000 people are over 60 and living alone. Of these, a fifth are considered socially isolated, meaning they do not meet friends or family more than twice a month. During the pandemic, Swedes joked darkly that it would be easy to isolate the elderly because “We don’t visit our grandparents much anyway.” Immigrants from places such as Africa or the Middle East are often shocked at how atomised Swedish families are.</p>
<p>Lars Tragardh, a historian, praises Sweden’s “statist individualism”. The state looks after people as individuals, so they can make their own choices and not have to rely on others, he says. Parents elsewhere envy the help that their Nordic peers receive, despite the higher taxes needed to pay for it. Still, even the most generous welfare state cannot offer love.</p>
<p>Helena Paues, who works for an association of local authorities in Sweden, describes how her father enjoys taking her dyslexic son, Wille, to museums. “He loves facts and science. I think his grandfather has taken him to all the museums in Stockholm: the science museum, the Viking museum, and so on. They have a very close bond. My father also struggled with learning to read and write when he was young.”</p>
<p>In the summer, the grandkids stay at their grandparents’ summer house, swim in the lake, and drink lemonade in a tree house. They clamour to do the same thing every year. Ms Paues says her father instils values such as respect for others. “He doesn’t need to talk about it, he does it by being himself. He teaches them that their opinions matter, because he listens to them.” She concludes: “As a child, you need more grown-ups than just your parents.”</p>

<p>​       人类一直未停止寻找外星人，其中最著名的 SETI 计划，是唯一由官方牵头，寻找外星人的计划。</p>
<p>​       文章指出：墨西哥州的Very Large Array (VLA)射电天文台将开始将其所有收集到的数据发送给cosmic，这是一个专门用于搜寻外星生物智慧的计算机集群。自去年 12 月以来，南非的Meerkat天文台也使用了类似的系统。在接下来的两年中，VLA单独将对 4 千万星星进行观察。计算机还将从以前的射电和可见光频率调查中挖掘数据，寻找任何不属于地球的不自然物。如果银河系中有许多高度发达的文明，并发出强烈的信号，这可能是一种正确的方法。</p>

<h2 id="原文">原文</h2>
<p>This month the vla (Very Large Array) radio-astronomy observatory in New Mexico will begin sending every bit of data it harvests for astronomers’ research projects to cosmic, a computer cluster dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (seti). A similar system has been piggybacking on the Meerkat observatory in South Africa (pictured) since December.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, the vla alone will cast an eye over 40m stars. Computers will also be mining data from past surveys, in radio frequencies and in visible light, for anything that seems both unnatural and not from Earth, says James Davenport, an astronomer at the University of Washington who works with such surveys.</p>
<p>If there are many technologically advanced civilisations in the galaxy, emitting powerful signals, this might well be the right approach, according to Steve Croft of the University of California, Berkeley. Some of them will then be where users of the vla happen to be looking. Either that, or they will be close enough to be detectable from existing survey data.</p>
<p>But if extraterrestrial civilisations are rare, and thus mostly far away, or if they rarely broadcast with a lot of power, they will be found only by selecting promising sources in advance and staring at them for a long time. This is done by the Green Bank Telescope, a large radio dish in West Virginia, for which the Berkeley seti Research Centre has contracted 20% of the observing time, with Dr Croft as project scientist.</p>
<p>Dr Davenport and Dr Croft were both addressing a session on detecting extraterrestrial intelligences at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, held in Seattle from January 8th-12th. This is a field that goes in and out of fashion, but at the moment fortune is smiling on it in the form of the Breakthrough Listen project, paid for by Yuri Milner, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist.</p>
<p>Breakthrough Listen, which began in 2016, is scheduled to last for ten years, and will disburse $100m over that period. The money is paying for observations by the Green Bank Telescope, Meerkat, the Parkes radio observatory in Australia and the Automated Planet Finder telescope at the Lick Observatory in California.</p>
<p>A question preoccupying Dr Croft is how to select Green Bank’s targets. One answer is to try to get inside et’s head (or equivalent brain-containing part of the anatomy). Starting from the assumption (admittedly generous) that there are beings out there who actively wish to talk to their galactic neighbours, how would they go about it?</p>
<p>As luck would have it, one obvious approach does et-seekers’ work for them. A good way to discover planets orbiting other stars is by looking for transits—brief diminutions in the light from a star caused by a planet passing in front of it, as seen from Earth. So far 3,941 planets orbiting other stars have been discovered that way. This method would also be obvious to extraterrestrial intelligences, and it would make sense for them to concentrate their broadcasts on planets they have discovered. For Earthbound seekers after aliens, this means they have to orient their antennas towards the Earth Transit Zone, a band across the sky from which Earth could be seen to transit the sun. Directing his telescope at planets known of in that zone would be a good gambit for Dr Croft.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is that garrulous ets might use supernovae to flag transmissions. That, Dr Davenport explained, might work like this. An extraterrestrial intelligence which wanted to make itself known would broadcast high-power signals of its existence every time its astronomers observed a supernova—and then wait.</p>
<p>What happens next is a complicated geometrical dance. Two wavefronts of electromagnetic radiation—one from the supernova and one from the et—are now spreading through space at the speed of light. For most potential listeners, they would arrive at different times, depending on their location with respect to both.</p>
<p><strong>Galactic semaphore</strong></p>
<p>It would make no sense for those seeking their galactic neighbours to start listening precisely when they saw a supernova, for they would not know where to look for any signal that might have been sent in response to it. But what such listeners, including those on Earth, could do, is go back to their archives and choose a supernova they saw in the past, say 1,000 years ago. The next step would be to see if there are any stars for which the time the supernova signal would take to travel there, plus the time for the broadcast it may have triggered to travel to Earth, would add up to 1,000 years as well. Those would be the stars from which signals could potentially be arriving at that moment.</p>
<p>As he told the meeting, Andy Nilipour of Yale University has been doing just this for supernovae described in 1054 by Chinese astronomers, in 1572 by Tycho Brahe, in 1604 by Johannes Kepler and in 1987 by many, many astronomers. Using data from Gaia, an orbiting observatory belonging to the European Space Agency, he is able to measure the locations of many stars with a precision of a few light-years. He has found 465 that fit the bill.</p>
<p>Such a level of precision is available, though, only for stars that are fairly close by. A complementary approach, proposed recently by Seto Naoki of Kyoto University, overcomes that by looking not at stars a certain distance from a supernova, but in a certain direction relative to it.</p>
<p>This would, Dr Seto outlined in a paper he published in 2021, work somewhat like a rugby player passing the ball to another who is running at full tilt. At any given time, there is a special direction to throw the ball, so that it will arrive while moving at right angles to the direction of the receiving player. In a similar way, you can at any particular moment find a special direction for two planets and a supernova. With luck, both parties will know to look in that direction to make contact. Mr Nilipour has also found 403 stars for which this approach would work, for a total of 868 between the two methods.</p>
<p>These approaches do, though, depend on et wishing to be found. Other civilisations may be shy, or simply not care. It may nevertheless be possible to discover where they are hiding.</p>
<p>In 2013, Andrew Siemion, who now works at the seti Institute, a non-profit organisation that has been active in the alien-searching business since 1984, proposed looking for systems where planets not only transit their star as viewed from Earth, but also regularly occult each other, which means two of them line up precisely in the direction of Earth. If both were inhabited by members of the same intelligent species, one having been settled from the other, they would presumably be in communication. That would require fairly powerful signals—and in this case they would be aimed in exactly the right direction to travel onward to Earth.</p>
<p>Evan Sneed of the University of California, Riverside, Sofia Sheikh of the seti Institute, and Nick Tusay of Penn State University are now doing the calculations for 60 promising systems where transits happen, to work out a calendar for observing them. So far, they have looked at seven.</p>
<p>Mr Tusay also told the conference about his search for extraterrestrial probes in the solar system. That such things exist is an even longer shot than looking for radio signals from afar. But that, in the view of seti enthusiasts, is not a reason not to try.</p>
<p>The question is, where to scout around? In principle, such probes could be anywhere. But there are places where they might be especially useful to their owners. These are where the sun’s gravity would concentrate light or radio waves from particular nearby star systems. It is easy to calculate that any signal from, say, Alpha Centauri, would be enhanced along a line pointing away from the sun in opposition to that star system, starting 550 times as far from the sun as Earth is.</p>
<p>That Alpha Centauri or any other nearby star system is home to an et is the longest of long shots. But, doubling down on what such civilisations might be capable of, Mr Tusay suggests probes like this might be relay stations, passing signals on to others in communication with other systems. This would make the solar system a node in a galactic internet of sorts.</p>
<p>Such probes might also exchange signals with counterparts in the centre of the solar system, closer to Earth, keeping an eye on what was happening there. That means those signals might be detectable.</p>
<p>Mr Tusay looked for such signals with the Green Bank Telescope, but found none. However, in the grand tradition of seti research, the motto of which seems to be “never give up”, this has not made him discard the idea just yet. Probes like this might communicate in ways no one has looked at or even thought of, or maybe they happened to be silent when the observations were done.</p>
<p><strong>Spiders, but not from Mars</strong></p>
<p>Carmen Choza of the Berkeley seti Research Centre, meanwhile, presented the results of a so-far fruitless search for beacons not in nearby star systems in the Milky Way, Earth’s home galaxy, but in 97 others. To be detectable from such distances any radio broadcasts would have had to be unbelievably powerful—and so presumably produced by civilisations that can harness the power of whole stars.</p>
<p>An intelligent species with such energy requirements would have a hard time hiding, if it even cared to. It might even become what Clément Vidal, a philosopher, calls a stellivore civilisation. Tapping the power of entire stars would require engineering on a grand scale. Dr Nilipour plans to look in this context at a special kind of star system called a spider pulsar.</p>
<p>Spider pulsars are thought to be neutron stars with a low-mass ordinary star orbiting so close that it is being destroyed by the neutron star’s emissions. Mr Nilipour wants to see if there is anything going on here that might not be quite natural.</p>
<p>His first step will be to spot stars in the growing Gaia catalogue which are on their way to having a close encounter with a spider pulsar. Anything about their relative motion that would require the influence of more than regular gravity would suggest a stellivore preparing to tuck into its next meal. He has already found some semi-promising candidates—in particular, some stars that may fall victim to such attention in 10,000 years or so.</p>
<p>There is no spider pulsar near Earth, fortunately. But such ideas, wild as they are, do raise the question of whether human beings should do more than just listen for signs of et. Talking, albeit with a time delay of decades or even centuries, with other intelligent species would be exhilarating. But if it involved organisms with that sort of power, it might also be pretty dangerous.</p>
